PCA Analysis of Dog vs Cat
In this notebook, I performed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on a dataset of images of dogs and cats. PCA helps us reduce the complexity of the data while keeping the important information. This analysis makes it easier to visualize the differences between the two groups (dogs and cats) based on their features.
